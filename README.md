## ðŸ“˜ About the Project

**get_next_line** is a [42 School] project that focuses on reading from a file descriptor **one line at a time**, handling multiple file descriptors simultaneously, and managing memory effectively.

This project is often a studentâ€™s first real encounter with:
- File descriptor management
- Static variables
- Buffer manipulation
- Dynamic string assembly in C

## ðŸ§  Project Goals

- Read a file **line by line** using only low-level functions like `read`.
- Handle reading from **multiple file descriptors**.
- Manage memory and buffer leftovers **without leaks**.
- Build a function with this exact prototype:

```c
char *get_next_line(int fd);
